Repository for NI Research Project: Center Membership and Interdisciplinary Collaborations

This repository contains data files for network analysis and Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Regression (GLMER) analysis. The data files are organized as follows:

**## 1. Edgelist for Network Analysis
- [**NI_Paper-Author_edgelist.csv**](https://github.com/lydinh92/NI_Research/blob/main/NI%20Data/NI_Paper-Author_edgelist.csv): This CSV file contains the edgelist data for network analysis. This is a two-mode network whereby paper is a source node, and author of a paper is a target node. This dataset is an input for our network analysis notebook, [**NI_Experiment_nb.ipynb**](https://github.com/lydinh92/NI_Research/blob/main/NI_Experiment_nb.ipynb).

**## 2. Data File for GLMER Analysis
- [**NI_GLMER_data.csv**](https://github.com/lydinh92/NI_Research/blob/main/NI%20Data/NI_GLMER_data.csv): This CSV file contains the data required for conducting Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Regression (GLMER) analysis. It includes the variables and observations needed for statistical modeling. This dataset is an input for our glmer analysis notebook, [**NI_GLMER_nb.R**](https://github.com/lydinh92/NI_Research/blob/main/NI_GLMER_nb.R).

## Usage

You can use the provided data files for your network analysis and GLMER analysis in Python and R. Please refer to the specific notebooks or scripts in this repository to load and analyze the data.
